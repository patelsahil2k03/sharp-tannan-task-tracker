Sharp And Tannan Task for Full Stack Developer
Q: Task Tracker Lite — User Authentication, Roles & Task
Management with Categories
1. User Authentication System
The system should include a User Authentication module that supports registration,
login, and logout functionality. For registration, the API must accept inputs such as
name, email, password, and confirm password. The password should always be
stored in a secure hashed form, and the system must ensure that each email
address is unique. For login, the API should accept an email and password, and if
the credentials are valid, it should return an authentication token (such as a JWT) or
establish a secure session. A logout API should also be provided to allow users to
terminate their session or invalidate their token. Additionally, all other APIs in the
application should be protected, ensuring that only authenticated users with a valid
token or session are able to access them.
2. Role Management
The system must implement Role Management with two types of users: Admin and
Normal User. Admin users should have full access to Category Management,
which means they can create, update, and delete categories. Normal users, on the
other hand, are restricted in their access — they cannot create, update, or delete
categories. Instead, they can only assign their tasks to the categories that have
already been created and maintained by Admin users.

The system should include a Categories Management feature that is accessible only
to Admin users. Through this functionality, Admins will be able to add new
categories such as “Work” or “Personal,” maintain an updated list of available
categories, make changes to existing categories whenever required, and also
remove categories that are no longer needed.
4. Task Management (All Users)
The system should provide a Task Management feature that is available to all users.
Each user should be able to add new tasks with details such as a title, description,
status (for example: Todo, Doing, or Done), a due date, and an associated category.
Users should also be able to view a list of their own tasks, update the details of
these tasks when required, and manage their progress by changing the status.
However, a user can only edit the status of a task before its due date; once the
due date has passed, the status can no longer be changed.
5. Admin Dashboard
The system should also include an Admin Dashboard that provides a complete view
of all tasks created by users. This dashboard should display each task along with its
due date and current status, giving Admins visibility into overall activity. To make
management easier, the dashboard should also include filtering options that allow
Admins to narrow down the list of tasks based on specific users, due dates, or task
statuses. This ensures that Admins can quickly identify pending work, overdue
tasks, or user-specific progress when needed.
Sharp And Tannan Associates6. Dockerized The Code
The final step of the project is to ensure the entire application is Dockerized so that
it can be run easily in any environment. The system should be packaged with Docker
in such a way that both the backend application and the database can be started
with a single command, typically using Docker Compose. All necessary
environment variables such as database credentials, ports, and secret keys should
be configurable through a .env file, and clear instructions should be provided in the
documentation.
Additional Information:
•
•
•
Use Node.js OR Python create APIs and backend services.
Choose MySQL or Postgres for the database.
Follow the MVC coding structure.
Code Submission:
•
•
•
The task should be completed within 24 hours.
A working demo video should be attached to the GitHub readme.
The code needs to be published on GitHub, and the GitHub repository link should
be provided in the email.
